# Linear_MCMC

This is the code for MCMC variable selection for linear dynamical systems. It is introduced in the article

A. Aalto and J. Goncalves. "Bayesian variable selection in linear dynamical systems", [arXiv:1802.05753](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05753), 2018.

Please cite the article if you use the method in your project. Further instructions on the method can be found in the
